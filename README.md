This is a recreation of the classic Minesweeper game, in which players will have to click on covered cells of a newly generated map to see if they hit a mine or if not. With every space that they live, a new area with a border of numbers would be presented depicting the number of mines in the cells directly adjacent to them. Clear every space and flag every mine without hitting any to win!  
This game is unique to the original as it takes dynamic memory allocation into account and lends map generation to the player as opposed to just the developer, allowing them to pick how many mines they want and how big of a map they want it to be.
